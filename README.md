# The AIROB Active-Knee-Orthosis
Welcome to the **Active-Knee-Orthosis** project by the AIROB-Lab! This README provides an overview of the 3D-Printed Mounting Clip for an Active Knee Orthosis.


## Description
This repository contains the design files and documentation for a **3D-Printed Clip** developed to securely attach an actuator to a knee orthosis. The clip is part of a system enabling an **impedance-controlled knee orthosis** for rehabilitation applications.

## Key Features
- **Custom Fit**: Designed to align the actuator's axis with the shifting center of knee rotation.
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Incorporates a linear adjustment mechanism to maintain torque transmission across the range of motion (ROM).
- **Durability**: Optimized for strength while minimizing material use.

- **Off-the-Shelf Parts:** 
The clips are compatible with the [GENUDYNÂ®CI STEP THRU](https://www.sporlastic.de/en/product/item/genudyn-ci-step-thru/) from Sportlastic and the [AK80-9 CubeMars T-Motor](https://www.mabrobotics.pl/product-page/ak80-9).


## Usage
When 3D printing, an infill density of minimum 50 is recommended. For better mechanical strength the parts should be printed in a direction so that the pins and other fragile strucutres are aligned parallel to the built plate.
